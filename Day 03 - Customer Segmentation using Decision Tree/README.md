# 🎯 Day 3: Customer Segmentation using Decision Trees & K-Means  

## 📌 Overview  
In this project, we implement **Customer Segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering** and **Decision Trees**. The goal is to group customers based on behavioral and demographic features and use a classifier to predict the segment of new customers.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn  
✅ Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Feature Scaling)  
✅ **K-Means Clustering** for Customer Segmentation  
✅ **Decision Tree Classifier** for Customer Group Prediction  
✅ Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-score  
✅ Feature Importance Analysis to understand key segmentation factors
