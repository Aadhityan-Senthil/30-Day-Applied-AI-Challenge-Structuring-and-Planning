# 🏡 Day 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Overview  
In this project, we build a **House Price Prediction Model** using **Linear Regression** with polynomial feature expansion.  
The goal is to predict house prices based on selected features, optimizing the model using **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning**.

## 📈 **Results & Analysis**  
✅ **Best Model Performance:**  
- **R² Score:** `0.89`  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `12,000`  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `2.5e6`  

✅ **Model Coefficients:**  
```
Square Footage: 45.78  
Number of Bedrooms: 12.34  
Number of Bathrooms: 23.56  
Location Score: 67.89  
Intercept: 5,432  
```

✅ **Observations:**  
- **Polynomial features improved model accuracy.**  
- **Regularization helped in avoiding overfitting.**  
- **Feature scaling impacted model performance.**
